# security-checklist

## How do I secure my server against a sophisticated adversary?

Goal: to have several combinations of system & application software & admin best practices selected to maximize security. The main scenario is a server (or several servers) running a web application (perhaps via TOR) for interacting with blockchain (typically Bitcoin or Ethereum). A good developer should be able to follow one of these checklists and end up with a reasonably secure system.
